How I used R to create a word cloud, step by step 
R is less scary than you thought! R, the open source package, has become the de facto standard for statistical computing and anything seriously data-related (note I am avoiding the term ¡®big data¡¯ here ? oops, too late!).  From data mining to predictive analytics to data visualisation, it seems like any self-respecting data professional now uses R. Or at least they pretend to. We all know that most people use Excel when nobody¡¯s watching. 
But anyway, R is immensely powerful. It is also command-line driven, which makes it quite scary, especially for those of us who don¡¯t get to be hands-on as often as we¡¯d like to. True, used in the wrong way, statistical algorithms can wreak havoc (garbage in ? garbage out), but don¡¯t let this intimidate you. I recently gave it a try myself and found myself hooked in a matter of minutes. And if I can do it, so can you! There are now many free online courses teaching R but some of these represent a significant investment of time. So to get started and experience a taster of how R works, I would recommend the following: create a world cloud. If you¡¯ve got 1-2 hours to fiddle around then the steps outlined below should help you create your first output with R. For example, here¡¯s a word cloud of all my tweets over the past 3 years:
